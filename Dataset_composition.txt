Client Analysis
	1.	Client Segmentation:
        •	Group clients by ECONOMIC_POT and ECO_POT_CLASS to identify high-value vs. low-value clients.
        •	Segment clients based on TRADE SECTOR and REGION to analyze purchasing behavior by industry and location.
	2.	Client Growth & Retention:
	    •	Track new client registrations over time (CLIENT_CREATE DATE).
	    •	Identify repeat customers by analyzing multiple purchases over different YYYYMM periods.
	3.	Risk Assessment:
	    •	Analyze how RISK_CAT affects purchase behavior and spending patterns.
	    •	Investigate whether high-risk clients spend differently than low-risk clients.

Sales Analysis
	4.	Sales Trends:
	    •	Examine total sales over time (YYYYMM).
	    •	Identify seasonal trends in NET purchase amounts.
	5.	Sales Channel Performance:
	    •	Compare NET sales across different SALES_CHANNEL codes.
	6.	Cancellation Rate:
	    •	Calculate the percentage of transactions marked as CANCELLED to understand order reliability.

Product Analysis
	7.	Top-Selling Items:
        •	Identify the most purchased ITEM_ID based on total NET sales.
        •	Analyze demand for different FAMILY_CODE and GROUP_CODE categories.
	8.	Tool vs. Parts/Materials Analysis:
	    •	If FLG_TOOL is defined, compare sales of tools vs. materials.
	9.	Sales by Unit Type:
	    •	Compare purchase frequency and revenue between UNIT values (e.g., pieces vs. bulk items).
